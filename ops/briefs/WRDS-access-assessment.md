# WRDS access assessment — P1-T2

**Status: BU WRDS access is gone.** CRSP (`crsp.holdings`, `crsp.portnomap`,
`crsp.stocknames`, `crsp.msf` shrout) and TAQ are not reachable from this seat.
The original T2 brief (Project_1.md §101-113) assumed WRDS credentials injected
via env; that assumption no longer holds.

## Decision: free EDGAR path, run in parallel to the frozen contract

ConvExp is a **holdings ratio**, not a price series, so it can be reconstructed
entirely from free public filings with equal rigor (meta-rule 1 is *satisfied*,
not diluted — every number keeps an EDGAR/OpenFIGI locator):

| WRDS piece | free substitute |
|---|---|
| `crsp.holdings` (fund holdings) | EDGAR **NPORT-P** `invstOrSec` (CUSIP, ticker, shares) |
| CUSIP → identity | N-PORT `<identifiers><ticker>`, else **OpenFIGI** `/v3/mapping` |
| ticker → issuer | SEC **company_tickers.json** (ticker → CIK) |
| `shrout` (shares outstanding) | SEC **XBRL** `dei:EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding` |
| `permno` key | deferred — CUSIP↔ticker↔CIK crosswalk merges to CRSP later |

N-PORT is already named as a T2 source in Project_1.md §108, so this is within
the original spec, not a workaround.

## What is NOT reproduced without CRSP/TAQ (downstream flags)

- `permno` — left blank; the crosswalk recovers it if CRSP access returns.
- `pre_etf_ownership` here = the **converting funds'** ownership only (== conv_exp).
  Total mutual-fund ownership would need the full CRSP MF universe; flagged.
- T4 (Saglam-Tuzun replication) and any TAQ-based T-tasks still need a price/TAQ
  source; out of scope for this step.

## Contract discipline

Frozen `ops/contracts/conv_exposure.yaml` is **untouched**. The free path emits
`conv_exposure_free.parquet` against the new parallel contract
`ops/contracts/conv_exposure_free.yaml`, which reproduces every frozen column
1:1 (same names) plus additive crosswalk/provenance columns. No frozen column is
renamed (CLAUDE.md rule 3).
# WRDS access — need assessment (P1 + refraction), 2026-07-18

Owner's WRDS account lapsed. Decision: borrow an account (paid) vs. buy specific
data (Xianyu). This maps every WRDS-touching task across the portfolio and
recommends an approach.

## Scope: only P1 and refraction need WRDS. E2 does NOT.
E2 (RWA looping) runs on **on-chain** data (Dune SQL / Morpho & Aave subgraphs) —
zero WRDS. So one WRDS account/dataset serves **P1 + refraction**, and E2 is
unaffected either way.

## Every WRDS-dependent task (the footprint is the whole empirical backbone)
| Task | WRDS data needed | When |
|---|---|---|
| **P1-T2-wrds** (now) | CRSP MF holdings (`crsp.holdings`/`portnomap`/`fund_hdr`), `crsp.stocknames` (CUSIP→PERMNO), `crsp.msf` (shrout, prc, mcap decile) | now |
| **P1-T3** (outcomes) | TAQ **WRDS Intraday Indicators (IID)** — effective spreads; CRSP **daily** (DSF); IBES SUE; possibly Compustat (GNZ earnings decomposition) | wk 4–6 |
| **P1-T4** replication | CRSP daily | after T2 |
| **P1-T5** main | conv_exposure + CRSP **daily** + TAQ **IID** | after T3 |
| **P1-T6 / T7** | consume cached panels — **no fresh WRDS** if pulls complete | later |
| **Refraction R2** | CRSP **daily returns** (with open prices for overnight/intraday split) + frozen P1 files (conv_exposure, holdings_weights, ibes_sue, events_merged) | after P1-T2 |
| **Refraction R10** | TAQ intraday ±90 min around announcements (non-blocking bypass) | optional |

Non-WRDS (don't factor in): USMPD is a **free** SF Fed download; CPI/NFP consensus
is a *separate* Bloomberg-ECO/license question (already a standing NEED_HUMAN).

**Conclusion on "later stages":** yes — WRDS is needed continuously from P1-T2
through T5 and refraction R2/R10. It is **not** a one-shot need; it is the spine
of both papers' empirics. But it collapses to a small set of **distinct data
pulls** that can all be taken in one sitting and cached.

## The five raw pulls that cover everything (take all in one window)
1. CRSP MF holdings for the **131 converting funds**, pre-conversion report periods (+ `fund_hdr`, `portnomap`) — well-bounded.
2. `crsp.stocknames` full CUSIP↔PERMNO reference — small.
3. `crsp.msf` (monthly) 2019–2026, full universe — shrout/prc/decile.
4. `crsp.dsf` (**daily**) for the treated+control universe over event windows — the big one.
5. TAQ **IID** (daily spread metrics) + IBES SUE for the universe/windows.

Everything downstream (conv_exposure, outcomes_panel, returns_ann, panel_ann) is
**derived** from these five and cached to disk — so once pulled, no re-access.

## How long do you need the account?
NOT continuous. The live-connection time is **hours**; the risk is iteration
(fund→PERMNO mapping, report-period alignment, look-ahead/leave-one-out checks).
Two patterns:
- **Naive:** keep the account across P1-T2→T5 + R2 debugging ≈ **3–6 weeks** on/off.
- **Recommended (sprint):** pre-write all pull scripts OFFLINE (they only need the
  connection at runtime), then borrow for **one concentrated block ≈ 3–7 days**,
  execute pulls 1–5 back-to-back, land every raw file immutable with lineage,
  release. T5/T6/T7 and refraction R3+ then run on the cache. I can pre-write the
  T3/T4/R2 pull scripts now (the T2 scaffold already exists), which is what makes
  the 3–7 day window realistic.

## If buying data instead — size
The universe is **endogenous** (defined by which stocks the converting funds held,
i.e. T2's output), so a fixed shopping list can't be fully specified up front.
Rough sizes if scoped to universe+windows:
- MF holdings (131 funds): < 50 MB · stocknames: ~tens of MB · MSF 2019–26: ~100–300 MB
- CRSP **daily** (universe×windows): ~1–3 GB (dominant) · TAQ IID: ~few hundred MB–1 GB · IBES SUE: ~few hundred MB
- **Total ≈ 2–5 GB** scoped; ~5–10 GB if you grab full-universe daily for safety.
(Raw TAQ is terabytes — you do **not** want that; you need the WRDS-computed IID,
which is a WRDS value-add product that's awkward to buy piecemeal.)

## Recommendation: BORROW (one sprint), don't piece-buy
Borrowing is easier and safer here:
1. **Iterative, multi-table, universe-endogenous** pipeline — you can't hand a
   seller a frozen file list; you'll discover you need one more column mid-build.
2. **Meta-rule 1** (the project's core discipline): every number must carry a WRDS
   table+query locator. An account preserves that; purchased CSVs of unknown
   vintage/provenance can fail the standard and can't be re-queried.
3. **One account covers both P1 and refraction** (shared frozen files + shared
   CRSP/TAQ). TAQ IID in particular is a WRDS product, not a loose dataset.
4. Cost is bounded by making it a **3–7 day sprint**, not a subscription.

**When buying is acceptable:** if you only want to unblock **T2 right now** and
defer the rest — a targeted purchase of (MF holdings for the 131 funds +
stocknames + MSF snapshot, < 400 MB, fully specifiable) gets conv_exposure built
and clears kill-switch gate 2. But you'll need CRSP-daily + TAQ + IBES for
T3/T5/R2 regardless, so plan to borrow for that phase.

## Action to compress the rental (offer)
Before you secure the account, seat C can pre-write the offline pull scripts for
P1-T3/T4 and refraction-R2 (like the T2 `holdings_pipeline.py` scaffold), each
landing raw immutable + lineage and refusing to invent table/column names. Then
the borrowed window is pure execution → ~3–5 days, one account, both papers.

## ADDENDUM — free alternatives (asked 2026-07-18)

### 0. The real "free": BU institutional WRDS
You're a BU affiliate (BU email; the plan already says "去 BU 确认" for USMPD/CPI
licensing). BU Questrom/library almost certainly holds an **institutional WRDS
subscription** — free to affiliates via a sponsored sub-account (advisor / course
/ library request). Your *personal* account lapsing ≠ BU access gone. This is the
cheapest legitimate path; try it before borrowing/buying.

### 1. T2 / ConvExp / kill-switch = FULLY buildable for FREE (holdings, not prices)
ConvExp = Σ(fund holding shares) / (shares outstanding). Every input is free +
provenance-clean (satisfies meta-rule 1 with EDGAR/OpenFIGI locators):
- **Fund holdings** → SEC **EDGAR NPORT-P** (each converting fund's last monthly
  holdings filing before its effective_date). Free, XML, and *already named in the
  spec* (Project_1.md line 108 lists "EDGAR N-PORT" alongside CRSP MF). All 131
  funds convert 2021-2026 → NPORT-P (mandatory since 2019) covers the whole sample.
- **CUSIP → ticker** → N-PORT's own fields + **OpenFIGI API** (free CUSIP↔ticker).
- **Shares outstanding (denominator)** → EDGAR **XBRL frames** API
  (`dei:EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding`), point-in-time, free — the CRSP
  `shrout` substitute.
- **Stock key** → use ticker or CIK instead of `permno` (a `conv_exposure` contract
  amendment), OR keep a ticker↔permno crosswalk to merge CRSP later.
→ **The immediate blocker needs no WRDS at all.** Build ConvExp free, clear the
kill-switch feasibility gate, THEN decide on WRDS for the returns phase — by which
point you know the project passed its own go/no-go.

### 2. Returns event study (T4/T5/R2) — free is workable for prototyping
- **Daily prices/returns/current shares** → `yfinance` (Yahoo), **Stooq**, Tiingo
  free tier — cover essentially all listed US stocks 2019-2026.
- **Gaps vs CRSP**: (a) delisting returns (Yahoo drops delisted tickers; refraction
  R2 explicitly wants "退市收益按 CRSP 规则" — not replicable free); (b) point-in-time
  historical shrout (Yahoo gives current). Minor for short event windows and
  large-cap-ish holdings; material for the *final publishable* run.

### 3. IBES SUE & Compustat — free substitutes exist
- **SUE** → skip analyst consensus (IBES, hard-free); use a **time-series /
  seasonal-random-walk SUE** from EDGAR earnings — the original Foster-Olsen-Shevlin
  definition, academically defensible with a footnote. Owner picks the definition.
- **Fundamentals (GNZ decomposition)** → EDGAR **XBRL** financials (free, messier).

### 4. TAQ intraday spreads — the one genuinely hard free item, but NON-BLOCKING
Raw TAQ = terabytes; the WRDS-computed IID has no clean free equivalent. But T3
spine-4 (cost side) and refraction R10 are both flagged **non-blocking bypass** in
the specs — the main results don't need TAQ. Defer; only WRDS/Databento can serve
it if you later want it.

### Recommended path (free-first, WRDS-last)
1. Build **T2/ConvExp free** from EDGAR N-PORT + OpenFIGI + XBRL shares → clear the
   kill-switch. (Seat C can write this now — no account needed.)
2. Prototype **T4/T5/R2 returns** on yfinance/Stooq → preliminary results.
3. Only if the project clears its gates and you want CRSP-grade final numbers,
   **borrow BU/an account for a 3-5 day sprint** to re-run the finalized pipeline
   on CRSP + pull TAQ if the cost-side spine is wanted. Free data does 90% of the
   build; WRDS becomes a short, final, provenance-upgrade pass — not a blocker.
